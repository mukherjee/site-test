Hello Glenn,
</p>
<p>
The Department of Career Planning and Development (DCPD) once again is having its annual Job Shadow Program. As a Kennesaw alumnus, we would like you to host one of the Owl Job Shadow Orientation workshops.
Volunteering helps keep Kennesaw strong and connected, and you can also connect with former or current students and contribute to our community.
</p>
<p>The Job Shadow Program is DCPD's flagship event, where Marching Owls come together for five days to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation opportunities to see what a career field looks like "in real life"</li>
<li>Connect classroom learning with workplace experience</li>
<li>Broaden the view of opportunities for students at many different companies</li>
<li>Create a starting point for learning how to network with professionals</li>
<li>Practice professionalism and business etiquette</li>
<li>Help to define potential career paths after graduation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in volunteering, visit the event page, and register your interest to participate.</p>
